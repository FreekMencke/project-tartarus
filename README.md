# Project Tartarus

## Intro

Project Tartarus is my hobby project. It's going to be a 2D dungeon crawler, with semi-randomized maps.

I'm writing the game in [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/), since I have already worked with it before, so I know what to expect. I also like the fact that it's a programming game development framework, no drag-and-drop stuff like Unity for example.

I'm currently still in the process of designing the internal mechanics of the engine, so there won't be any real gameplay for while yet.
